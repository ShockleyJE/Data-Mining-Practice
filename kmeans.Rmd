```{r}
# This code loads the required packages:
library(stats)
library(printr)
```

```{r}
# This code removes the Species column from the iris dataset.
# Then it uses k-means to create 3 clusters:
model <- kmeans(x = subset(iris, select = -Species), centers = 3)
```

```{r}
# This code generates a confusion matrix for the results:
table(model$cluster, iris$Species)
