# Data Mining Practice
Practice using R with examples of data mining patterns. Inspired by [this](http://rayli.net/blog/data/top-10-data-mining-algorithms-in-plain-english/) article

Props to Ray Li, I was following along and wanted to throw up my workspace in case anyone was having trouble

Knitr is used and the outputs of each example can be viewed by clicking the hyperlinks below

We'll be training and testing the algorithms using the iris data set included with R Studio

### C5.0

Trains C5.0 with 3 different species of irises and recognize it

### K-means

Using k-means, we’re looking to form groups (a.k.a. clusters) around data that “look similar.”
